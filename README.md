# FoodTruckProject

## Description

## How to run
The program starts by asking the user for the name, type, and rating of a food truck. The user will be allowed to enter the information of up to five food trucks or enter quit for the name field to enter fewer than 5 food trucks. 

After the user has entered the data for all food trucks, the users will then be shown a menu of available options to choose from. \

User Menu
1) List all existing food trucks
2) Show average food truck rating

If the user makes a valid selection, the appropriate information will be shown, otherwise, the user will be informed that an invalid selection was made and the user menu will be displayed again. 

## Technologies

Java: This program was completed using only java. \
Scanner: The scanner library is used to get input from the user. 

## Lessons Learned

OOP: Using OOP we can group data and the methods that work on it together making our code more readable and easier to debug. 

Encapsulation: Using access modifiers we can limit the visibility of our data and control how the user can interact with it.
